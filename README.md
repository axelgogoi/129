# 129
repo for ME/CS/EE 129, spring 2021-2022

If you're taking ME/CS/EE 129 in the future and are thinking of stealing my code, don't, because

1. 

2. It's against the Honor Code, and if Caltech sees students aren't following the Honor Code, they'll get rid of it and you'll be stuck taking proctored exams and writing essays by hand.

3. The code in this repository is outdated and inefficient (I'm not a CS major believe it or not) and probably useless for you because we literally used *stepper motors* instead of the normal ones. The class has changed a lot since I took it, and will continue to change. So just don't copy my code.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
